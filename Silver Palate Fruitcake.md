# Silver Palate Fruitcake

This recipe seems to have originated in the Silver Palate _Good Times_ cookbook,
where it's called  Saint Nicholas Cake.  It's  an uncommon style  that's popular
with  people who  love fruitcake but  hate citron.  My parents  make a batch for
friends and family every Christmas.

This is a  very polarizing dessert!  People tend to be either completely in love
with it or complletely indifferent.


## Ingredients & Instructions

- loaf pans
- butter
- foil

See the Notes section for pan sizes. Line the pans with buttered foil. A "sling"
of foil that goes under the long sides and bottom of each pan works nicely.

- 8 C pitted dates (about 3 lb)
- 8 C walnut halves (about 1 3/4 lb)
- 1 C candied cherries (about 6 oz)
- 1/2 C white flour

Mix chunky ingredients in a very large bowl. Break up dates as well as possible.
Sprinkle with flour and toss to coat.

- 6 egg yolks
- 3/4 C white sugar
- 3/4 C brown sugar
- 6 T butter, melted
- 4 1/2 T heavy cream
- 6 tsp vanilla
- 2 tsp orange zest
- 1/2 tsp almond extract

Beat egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in butter, cream, vanilla,
zest, and extract.

- 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour
- 2 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 6 egg whites

Mix whole wheat flour and baking powder,  then stir these into the batter.  Beat
egg whites until  stiff peaks form;  fold into the batter.  Pour over the chunky
ingredients and mix until everything is coated.

Spoon into prepared loaf pans, mounding slightly. Cover pans with buttered foil.
Bake at 325 F  for 40 minutes,  then remove top foil.  Continue baking until the
centers are firm to touch, 15 or 20 minutes longer.

- cheesecloth
- rum or bourbon

Cool loaves.  Cut cheesecloth into strips and soak in alcohol. Wrap each loaf in
a soaked cheesecloth,  then wrap tightly in foil.  Age for a week or two at room
temperature.


## Notes

Individual loaves can be whatever size you want. Cooking times remain unchanged.
One recipe makes one of the following:

- Three 9x5x3 loaves; or
- Five 7x3x2 loaves; or
- Eight 5x2.5x2 loaves.

Aging these in alcohol is optional,  but improves  both the flavor and the shelf
life.  The original recipe  doesn't include this step,  and says that  the cakes
should be eaten within two weeks.

We typically use two or three cups of cherries, not just one.
