# Bratwurst and Onions

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1/4 C beer
- 3 T Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp dried thyme

Mix the beer, mustand, and thyme to make a dressing.

- 1 large red onion
- salt
- oil

Cut onion into thin slices, then caramelize it with the oil and salt.  Once it's
nicely browned, add half the dressing and cook a bit more.

- 3 bratwurst, halved lengthwise
- 2 slices caraway rye bread

Brown the bratwurst and toast the rye bread. Brush the toast with dressing, then
top with bratwurst followed by onions.  Drizzle the remaining dressing on top.


## Notes

The recipe this is based on  uses thicker slabs of onion and cooks everything on
a barbeque or grill. This keeps everything together better, and lets you eat the
results as open-faced sandwiches.  I find it much easier to do everything on the
stovetop, but the result is messier and needs a knife and fork.

The recipe above  is for two people,  but can be easily multiplied.  You'll want
one slice of bread, three bratwurst halves, and half an onion per person.
