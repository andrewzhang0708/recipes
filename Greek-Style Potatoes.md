# Greek-Style Potatoes

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2 lb yukon gold potatoes
- 1 T vegetable oil
- 1 T butter

Clean the potatoes and cut them into wedges.  Heat the butter and oil in a large
skillet.  Fry the potato wedges until golden brown, about five minutes per side.
Work in batches so as not to crowd the pan.

- 4 cloves garlic
- 3 T fresh oregano
- 1 T olive oil
- 2 T lemon juice
- 1 T lemon zest
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper

Place all the potatoes back in the skillet.  Cover and cook until tender.

While the potatoes are cooking, mince the garlic.  Mix the seasonings in a small
bowl.  When the potatoes are tender (about six minutes) add the seasonings, stir
gently, and cook for two minutes more.

- fresh parsley

Serve topped with chopped parsley.


## Notes

If you don't have fresh oregano, you can use one third the amount of dried.
