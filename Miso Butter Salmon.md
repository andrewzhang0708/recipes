# Miso Butter Salmon

Makes two servings.

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2 fillets salmon (or other fish), about 1/2 # each
- salt
- pepper
- flour

Pat dry the salmon with paper towel and season the salmon (generously) with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle flour on the salmon and thinly coat it all over. The flour prevents juice from leaking, creates a nice brown surface and acts as a sauce thickner.

- 1 T cooking oil

Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat.

- 2 T miso
- 2 tsp sugar
- 2 T sake
- 2 T mirin
- 3 T soy sauce

While the oil is heating, mix these ingredients in a bowl.

Cook the salmon skin-side up for 3-5 minutes depending on how thick your fillet/steak is. 

- shimeji mushrooms
- shiitake mushrooms

Take out your favorite mushrooms, slice the shiitakes, hand-pull the shimejis apart.

- 2 T butter

Flip the fish and cook the other side for 3-5 minutes. Meanwhile, add butter and mushrooms, saute the mushrooms on the side. 

Continue to cook the sides of the salmon a bit if you've got thick ones. Coat the salmon and mushrooms with sauce, cook for another minute or so until sauce thickens. Don't overcook fish!

- chives, chopped (optional)
- white sesame seeds (optional)

Garnish and serve!

## Notes

This is based on [recipe][1]. I reduced the sugar because I'm too Asian to appreciate it. Shh.
