# French Silk Pie

## Ingredients

- One [pie crust][1], prebaked

- 1 C white sugar
- 3/4 C butter, softened
- 3 oz unsweetened chocolate
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla

- 1-2 C whipping cream
- powdered sugar
- vanilla

## Instructions

Prebake pie crust until golden.  Cool completely.

Beat the butter and sugar until creamy.  Melt the chocolate; cool, but ensure it
stays liquid; add it to the butter mixture.  Continue beating.  Add the eggs and
vanilla.

Transfer the filling to the crust.  Refrigerate until set.

Whip the cream  just before serving,  adding powdered sugar  and / or vanilla if
desired.  Cover the filling completely with whipped cream.


## Notes

Make sure the crust has cooled  completely  before adding the filling.  If it is
still warm, the filling will melt,  resulting in a darker, tougher layer next to
the crust.
