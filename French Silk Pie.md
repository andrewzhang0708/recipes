# French Silk Pie

### Crust

Pre-bake one [pie crust][1].  Cool completely.


### Filling

- 1 C white sugar
- 3/4 C butter, softened
- 3 oz unsweetened chocolate
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla

Melt the chocolate.  Let it cool, but not harden.

Beat the butter and sugar  until creamy.  Mix in the melted chocolate,  then the
eggs and vanilla.  Transfer the filling to the crust.  Refrigerate until set.


### Topping

- 1-2 C whipping cream
- 1/4 C powdered sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla
- cocoa powder

Just before serving,  whip the cream,  powdered sugar,  and vanilla.  Cover  the
filling completely with whipped cream.  Sprinkle with cocoa if desired; serve.


## Notes

Make sure the crust has cooled  completely  before adding the filling.  If it is
still warm, the filling will melt,  resulting in a darker, tougher layer next to
the crust.

Measurements in the topping section are all approximate.  I just wing it.
