# Shahi Paneer

This is a homebrew recipe, an attempt to recreate the fantastic shahi paneer you
can get at the Punjab Palace in Riverside, California. I'll often make it with a
side of [non-naan][2].


## Paneer

Make a batch of [paneer][1] first, so it can set while you cook.


## Whole Spices

- 4 tsp coriander seed
- 2 tsp cumin seed
- oil

Fry the cumin and coriander seeds in oil until fragrant.


## Curry Base

- 1 large onion, minced
- 6 oz tomato paste
- 2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 4 oz cashews
- 3 in ginger
- salt

Grind the ginger and half of the cashews into a paste. Add the paste, water, the
turmeric, cayenne, tomato paste, the minced onion, and 2 tsp of  garam masala to
the frying seeds.  Fry a bit more.


## Body

- 2 large onions
- 1 C golden raisins
- 4 oz whole cashews
- paneer

Chop the onions into one-inch squares.  Cut the paneer into one-inch cubes.  Add
both of these, whole cashews, the raisins, some salt, and some water. Cook until
it's done.


## Finishing

- 1 tsp ground cardamom
- 1 tsp garam masala
- fresh cilantro
- 1/4 C sugar
- cream
- salt

Just before serving, add the ground spices and the cilantro. Add cream until you
get a nice consistency.  Season with salt and sugar.
