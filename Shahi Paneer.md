# Shahi Paneer

This  is an attempt  to recreate  the fantastic  shahi paneer you can get at the
Punjab Palace  in  Riverside,  California.  I'll often  make  it  with a side of
[non-naan][2].


### Paneer

Make a batch of [paneer][1] first, so it can set while you cook.


### Whole Spices

- 4 tsp coriander seed
- 2 tsp cumin seed
- oil

Fry the cumin and coriander seeds in oil until fragrant.


### Curry Base

- 3 in ginger
- 4 oz cashews
- 1 large onion, minced
- 6 oz tomato paste
- 2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 2 tsp garam masala
- water
- salt

Grind the ginger and cashews into a paste.  Add this paste  to the frying seeds.
Add the minced onion, tomato paste, ground spices, salt, and a little water. Fry
a bit more.


### Body

- 2 large onions
- 1 C golden raisins
- 4 oz whole cashews
- paneer
- water

Chop the onions into one-inch squares.  Cut the paneer into one-inch cubes.  Add
both of these, whole cashews, the raisins, some salt, and some water. Cook until
it's done.


### Finishing

- 1 tsp ground cardamom
- 1 tsp garam masala
- fresh cilantro
- 1/4 C sugar
- cream
- salt

Just before serving, add the ground spices and the cilantro. Add cream until you
get a nice consistency.  Season with salt and sugar.


## Notes

Some  ingredients appear in multiple sections.  You should have a total of eight
ounces of cashews (you should be able to get an eight-ounce can),  three onions,
and three teaspoons of garam masala.
