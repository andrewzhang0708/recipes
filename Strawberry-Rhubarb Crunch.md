# Strawberry-Rhubarb Crunch

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 4 C strawberries
- 4 C rhubarb
- 3/4 C sugar
- 5 T flour

Chop  the strawberries and rhubarb.  Place the chunks in a large bowl.
Add sugar and flour and mix.  Pour into a 9x13-inch casserole dish.

- 1 1/2 C flour
- 1 C brown sugar
- 1 C rolled oats
- 1 C butter, softened

Knead the topping ingredients together  in a large bowl.  Crumble over
the fruit.  Bake at 375 F for 45 minutes.


## Notes

This works for just about any fruit, though you may need to adjust the
sugar.  Berries are traditional.  Strawberry-mango crunch is very good
as well.
