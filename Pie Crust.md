# Pie Crust

This recipe makes a single crust, suitable for an open-faced pie like pecan. For
pies with both a top and bottom crust, like apple, double the recipe.


## Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 C flour
 - 1/2 C cold butter
 - 1/4 C cold water
 - 1/2 tsp salt


## Instructions

Knead all the ingredients together until they form a dough.  If the dough is too
wet, add a little flour; if it is slightly dry, keep kneading, and the warmth of
your hands will  melt the butter until  the consistency is right.   If it's very
dry, add a little more water.

Let sit for a little while, then roll and place in a pie pan.

If you need a pre-baked crust,  like for a cream pie,  cover with tinfoil, weigh
down with pie weights, and bake at 400 F for ten minutes. Remove the weights and
foil and keep baking until golden, another five or ten minutes.


## Notes

If you want a puffier, breadier crust -  I like to use these on meat pies  - use
self-raising flour.  If you don't have any,  make your own by adding between 1/2
and 1 1/2 tsp baking soda to the flour.
