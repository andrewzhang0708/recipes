the tablespoon, three inches apart. Bake at 350 F until brown, about 10 minutes.


## Notes

We inherited this recipe from my grandmother, Naomi Burk, n√©e Brown.

This dough gets extremely thick,  and will probably overwhelm an electric mixer.
Be prepared to get a bit of a workout mixing the raisins in by hand.
