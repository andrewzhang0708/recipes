# Hungarian Allspice Poppyseed Wafers

Makes about five dozen cookies.

## Ingredients and instructions

- 2 C flour
- 2 T poppyseeds
- 2 tsp ground allspice
- 1/4 tsp salt

Mix dry ingredients in a small bowl.

- 1 C sugar
- 1 C butter, room temperature
- zest of one orange
- 2 egg yolks

Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until fluffy.  Add the orange zest and
egg yolks.  Mix in the dry ingredients.

Roll the dough into half-inch balls;  place these three inches apart  on greased
cookie sheets.  Use a thumb or pestle to make a well in each ball. Bake at 350 F
until golden, about 12 minutes.

- 1 C powdered sugar
- 2 T cream
- poppyseeds

Mix  powdered sugar and cream  to make a glaze.  Spoon into the wells.  Sprinkle
with poppyseeds.


## Notes

If the dough sticks to your thumb/pestle, dip it in powdered sugar before making
each well.  The sugar will stick to the dough, leaving your poker clean.
