Makes about twenty-six cookies.

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2 C flour
- 1/2 C almond meal
- 4 tsp ground cardamom
- 1/8 tsp salt

Mix dry ingredients in a small bowl.

- 3/4 C butter, room temperature
- 1/2 C sugar

Beat  butter and sugar  in a large bowl  until fluffy.  Stir in dry ingredients.
Press dough into one-inch balls.

- 6 T powdered sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp ground cardamon
- sliced almonds (optional)

Mix powdered sugar and cardamom  in a small bowl.  Roll cookies in this mixture,
then place two inches apart on a greased cookie sheet. Use the bottom of a glass
to  press  each ball to  half-inch thickness.  Press a  sliced almond  into each
cookie if desired.  Bake at 375 F until light brown, about 14 minutes.


## Notes

This is a very fragile dough and needs to be pressed into balls, not rolled.  If
you try to roll it, it will crumble.
