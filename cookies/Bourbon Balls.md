# Bourbon Balls

Makes about five dozen cookies.

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2 1/2 C crushed vanilla wafers

- 1 C powdered sugar
- 2 T cocoa powder

Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.

- 3 T corn syrup
- 1/4 C bourbon

Add corn syrup and bourbon.

- powdered sugar

Roll dough into little balls,  then roll in powdered sugar.  If the dough is too
dry to work easily,  add more bourbon!  These can be eaten immediately,  but are
