# Mexican Triple Chocolates

## Cookies

Pre-heat oven  to 350 F.  You can toast the walnuts  as the oven heats up;  this
will take about ten minutes.

- 1/4 C flour
- 1/4 C cocoa powder
- 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp baking powder
- pinch salt

Mix the dry ingredients in a medium bowl.

- 6 T butter, room temperature
- 7 T sugar
- 2 eggs

Beat butter, sugar, and eggs in a large bowl until smooth.

- 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate, melted and cooled
- 1 C walnuts, toasted and chopped
- 1 C (6 oz) milk chocolate chips

Add melted chocolate and beat until mixed, then add the dry ingredients. Add the
toasted walnuts and milk chocolate chips.

Drop by the tablespoonful  onto a greased baking sheet.  Bake at 350 F until the
cookies  look dry and cracked  but feel soft when pressed, about eleven minutes.
Let rest for five minutes, then remove from the baking sheet to cool completely.


## Garnish

- semi-sweet chocolate, melted
- walnut halves

Press a walnut half into each cookie.  Drizzle with melted chocolate.


## Notes

I never bother with the garnish.
