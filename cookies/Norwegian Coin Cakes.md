# Norwegian Coin Cakes

Makes about five dozen cookies.

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 1/2 C almonds

Blanch the almonds  by boiling them  for a few minutes  and then rinsing in cold
water. They should then easily pop out of their skins when squeezed.  Remove and
discard the skins.

- 1 C butter
- 1 1/2 C sugar
- 1 1/2 C flour

Beat the butter until light. Add the sugar and flour. Chop the almonds very fine
and add them as well.  Shape dough into a pair of 12-inch cylinders. Wrap in wax
paper and refrigerate until firm.

Slice cylinders  into 1/4-inch coins  and place on greased baking sheets,  about
three inches apart.  Bake at 350 F until just barely golden, about 10 minutes.


## Notes

Bake times for these vary wildly for some reason. You may need to bake for up to
twenty minutes in some cases.

These spread quite a bit in the oven - so much so that I'm not convinced the bit
with the cylinders  makes any difference.  Spooning the dough  directly onto the
baking sheets would likely work just as well.
