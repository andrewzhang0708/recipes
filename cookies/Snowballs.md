# Snowballs

Makes about five dozen cookies.

## Ingredients & Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 F.  You can toast the nuts  while the oven is heating;  this
should take about ten minutes.

- 1 C shortening
- 1/2 C powdered sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 1 tsp salt

Beat the shortening,  powdered sugar,  vanilla,  and salt  in a large bowl until
fluffy.

- 2 C flour
- 2 C pecans, toasted and chopped

Stir in the flour and chopped nuts. Mix well.  Shape the dough into 1-inch balls
and place on a greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 F for 15 minutes.

- powdered sugar

A few minutes  after the cookies  come out  of the oven,  roll them  in powdered
sugar while they're still warm.  After they cool,  roll them in powdered sugar a
second time.


## Notes

The original recipe just calls for "nuts", but I prefer pecans.

The outer layer of the cookies  will probably stick to your fingers  when you do
the  hot roll.  This doesn't mean they're  not fully cooked;  they're just kinda
sticky.

These are also known as Russian Tea Cakes and Mexican Wedding Cakes.
