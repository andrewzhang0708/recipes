# Potato Soup

## Ingredients

- 1 onion
- 2 medium potatoes
- 1 celery
- 3 T butter
- 2 C chicken broth
- 1/2 C milk
- salt
- pepper
- dill weed


## Instructions

Cut all vegetables into 1 cm cubes.

In a large pot, melt butter, caramelize the onions. Add celery cubes and stir, add potato cubes and stir. Add broth/water until barely covering everything. Add salt and pepper (lots of pepper seems to be the secret of this soup). Simmer, stir once in a while, until you can easily press the potato cubes on the side of the pot.

Stir, press the potatoes, reduce the soup volume, adjust the taste by adding more salt and pepper. Add milk, bring to boil, cook for another five minutes. Sprinkle dill weed right before serving.
