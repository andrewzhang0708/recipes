# Tamale Pie

## Ingredients & Instructions

Chop all ingredients.  Fry the bacon in a large skillet until crisp,
then add the onion and bell pepper.  Saut√© until tender.

Add ground beef.  Cook through.  Add spices.

Chop the olives.  Add them, the corn, and both cans of tomatoes.
Simmer for fifteen minutes.  Transfer to a greased 12x8x2 casserole
dish.

Mix the cornbread in a small bowl, then spoon on top of the casserole.
Top with grated cheddar.  Bake at 375 F for 30 to 40 minutes.


## Notes

Package sizes are approximate.  The last time I made this the tomato
soup can was 11 3/4 ounces, and the cornbread box was 8 1/2 ounces.

The filling can be made in advance and refrigerated.  If you do this,
bring it up to room temperature before adding the toppings and baking.
