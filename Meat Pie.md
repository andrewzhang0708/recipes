# Meat Pie

## Ingredients

 - 2 [self-raising pie crusts][1]

 - 3 large apples
 - 3 large onions
 - 1 lb ground beef or pork
 - 1/4 C brown sugar
 - salt
 - oil


## Instructions

Mix your pie crust  in the beginning.  Set the dough aside  to let it meld while
you make the filling.

Chop the apples and onions; saut√© them with the oil, salt, and brown sugar until
soft.  Add the ground meat.  Keep cooking until the onions caramelize.

Divide your dough in half.  Roll out the bottom crust and line your pie pan. Add
the filling.  Roll out the top crust and put it on top. Crimp the edges and stab
some holes in the top for ventilation.

Bake at 350 F until golden, about an hour.
