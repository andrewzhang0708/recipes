# Balsamic Onions

## Ingredients

- 2 lb pearl onions
- 2/3 C dried currants
- 2 T balsamic vinegar
- 1 C ruby port
- 3 tsp thyme
- butter
- salt


## Instructions

In a skillet,  simmer the onions, currants, port, 1 T vinegar and 2 tsp thyme in
butter.  Remove from heat. Add the remaining 1 T vinegar and 1 tsp thyme. Season
with salt.


## Notes

You can often find frozen pearl onions in the supermarket - these are pre-peeled
and will save you a  huge amount  of prep work.  If you can't find pearl onions,
shallots make a good "small onion" substitute.
