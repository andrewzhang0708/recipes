# Mother's Banana Cream Pie

This is a much larger, much more banana-ey version of my original [cream pie][2]
recipe.


## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 [pie crust][1]

Make and prebake the pie crust.  Use a ten-inch pie plate.  This pie is big.

- 1 1/3 C sugar
- 2/3 C flour
- 1/2 tsp salt

Mix the dry ingredients in a large saucepan.

- 8 egg yolks
- 4 C whole milk

Add the egg yolks to the dry ingredients. Mix well. Then add the whole milk. Mix
until blended,  then move the saucepan to the stove.  Cook over medium-high heat
until  the mixture thickens  and starts to boil.  Stir constantly to keep a film
from forming on the bottom of the pan.

- 3 T butter
- 2 tsp vanilla

Remove from heat and add the butter and vanilla. Stir until smooth.  Refrigerate
until chilled.

- 5 bananas

Slice the bananas  and fill the bottom of the pie crust  with a spiral of banana
slices  (about two bananas).  Pour the chilled filling into the crust.  Top this
with another spiral of banana slices.

- 2 C whipping cream
- 3 T powdered sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla

Whip the cream, sugar, and vanilla until peaks form. Top the pie with the cream.
Refrigerate until fully chilled.


## Notes

It's unclear who the mother in the recipe name is.  My mother says she found the
recipe in a magazine, possibly _Bon Appetit_.

To prevent a skin from forming while chilling the filling, you can press plastic
wrap onto the surface of the filling.
