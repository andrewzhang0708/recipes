# Odd Stew

## Ingredients

 - 4 yellow onions
 - salt
 - oil

 - 3 C vegetable broth
 - 3 lbs yams

 - 1 lb polish sausage
 - 4 green apples
 - 2 lbs carrots

 - 2 T worchestershire sauce
 - 1/2 tsp ground cloves
 - salt


## Instructions

Saut√©  the onions with oil and salt in a  Dutch oven until caramelized.  Cut the
yams into chunks and add them to the onions along with the vegetable broth.  Let
simmer for a while.

Chop the apples and carrots and thinly slice the sausage.  Add all of these. Let
simmer for a while longer.

Add the Worchestershire sauce and cloves.  Season with salt.


## Notes

The term "Polish sausage"  isn't really descriptive - the Polish are really into
their sausages,  and there are dozens of varieties.  The one I've used and liked
is an uncooked pork sausage that I think is mainly flavored with coriander. This
goes quite  well with the other  ingredients.  If using a different sausage, you
may want to add coriander seed - perhaps fry it in the oil in the very beginning
as you would for an Indian curry.

And as this is  a stew,  you can vary the amounts of things pretty freely.  This
recipe was recorded  the second time I made it,  and has significantly more yams
and  carrots.  To reproduce  the original version, which has  a more  pronounced
sweet-and-sour taste, cut the yams and carrots by half, remove one apple and one
onion, and adjust the seasonings to taste.
