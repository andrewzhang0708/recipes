# Odd Stew

## Ingredients & Instructions

 - 4 yellow onions
 - salt
 - oil

 Saut√© the onions with oil and salt in a Dutch oven until caramelized.

 - 3 C vegetable broth
 - 3 lbs yams

 Cut the yams into chunks and add them to the onions.  Add vegetable broth.
 Simmer for a while.

 - 1 T crushed red pepper (optional)
 - 1 lb polish sausage
 - 4 green apples
 - 2 lbs carrots

Chop the apples and carrots and thinly slice the sausage.  Add all of these.  If
you're using crushed red pepper, add it now as well.  Simmer for a while longer.

 - 2 T worchestershire sauce
 - 1/2 tsp ground cloves
 - salt

Add the Worchestershire sauce and cloves.  Salt to taste.


## Notes

The term "Polish sausage"  isn't really descriptive - the Polish are really into
their sausages,  and there are dozens of varieties.  The one I've used and liked
is an uncooked pork sausage that I think is mainly flavored with coriander. This
goes quite  well with the other  ingredients.  If using a different sausage, you
may want to add coriander seed - perhaps fry it in the oil in the very beginning
as you would for an Indian curry.

And as this is  a stew,  you can vary the amounts of things pretty freely.  This
recipe was recorded  the second time I made it,  and has significantly more yams
and  carrots.  To reproduce  the original version, which has  a more  pronounced
sweet-and-sour taste, cut the yams and carrots by half, remove one apple and one
onion, and adjust the seasonings to taste.
