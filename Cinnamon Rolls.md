# Cinnamon Rolls

This recipe makes  36 cinnamon rolls in total:  two 9-inch round pans containing
8 glazed rolls each, and a 9x13 pan containing 20 caramel rolls.  Each type uses
exactly half of the dough and filling.


### Dough

This takes a total of 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 cups of flour.

- 2 C flour
- 1/2 C sugar
- 3 pkg yeast
- 2 tsp salt

Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.

- 1 C water
- 1 C milk
- 1/2 C butter

Heat the wet ingredients in a small saucepan until very warm (120 to 130 F). Add
to the dry ingredients and blend well.

- 2 to 3 C flour

Mix in more flour until a stiff dough forms.

- 1 to 1 1/2 C flour

Knead in the remaining flour  until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Let it sit
in a greased, covered bowl until it has doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Punch
down and let sit for 15 more minutes.


### Filling

- 1/2 C butter, melted
- 2/3 C brown sugar
- 1 T cinnamon

While the dough is resting, mix all ingredients into a paste.


### Caramel Coating

- 1/2 C brown sugar
- 1/2 C butter, melted
- 2 T corn syrup
- 1/4 C toasted pecans

While the dough is resting,  mix the butter, sugar, and corn syrup.  Pour into a
9x13 baking pan.  Sprinkle with chopped pecans.


### Rolling

Split the dough  in half.  Roll half of the dough  into a  12x20-inch rectangle.
Spread with  half of the filling.  Roll up  into a 20-inch cylinder.  Slice into
twenty 1-inch slices; place these in the 9x13 pan on top of the caramel.

Roll the other half  of the dough into a  12x16-inch rectangle.  Spread with the
remainder of the filling. Roll up into a 16-inch cylinder and slice into sixteen
1-inch slices.  Place these into two greased 9-inch round cake pans.

Cover all pans with foil or plastic wrap.  Refrigerate at least two hours.


### Baking

Preheat oven to 375 F.  Take the rolls out of the refrigerator and let stand for
ten minutes.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until deep golden brown.

Cool briefly, then invert onto serving trays.


### Glaze

- 1 C powdered sugar
- 1 to 2 T cream
- 1/2 tsp vanilla

Combine all ingredients.  Drizzle over the non-caramel rolls.


## Notes

These are my family's  traditional Christmas morning breakfast.  We like to make
the rolls the night before, so all we have to do in the morning is pull them out
of the refrigerator and bake them.

The original recipe is from an old Pillsbury  _Come for Brunch_ cookbook (1982),
and calls for Pillsbury bread flour.
