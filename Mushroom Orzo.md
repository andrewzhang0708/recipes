# Mushroom Orzo

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 large leek
- 4 shiitake mushrooms
- 1 T olive oil

Thinly slice the leek and shiitakes. Sauté in a large skillet with the olive oil
until almost tender.

- 1 portobello mushroom, 3 in diameter
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 tsp dried rosemary
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp salt
- black pepper

Slice the portobello. Add it, the garlic, and the herbs and spices.  Sauté a few
minutes more.

- 1 C orzo
- 3 C vegetable stock
- 6 oz porcini mushrooms

Add the orzo, vegetable stick, and porcinis.  Simmer until you reach the desired
consistency, stirring frequently.

- 1 T fresh parsley

Chop the parsely fine.  Use it as garnish when serving.


## Notes

The original recipe is really fiddly; the version above is the simplified one we
actually use.  If you want to reproduce the original:

- Use dried porcinis  and reconstitute them  in hot water  before doing anything
  else.  Add the mushroom water along with the vegetable stock.
- Add the shiitake stems along with the leeks,  but keep the caps separate.  Add
  the caps along with the portobellos.
- Add the vegetable stock  as you would for a risotto:  start by adding half the
  stock, then stir as it cooks down.  Then add a little more and cook some more,
  and so on.
- Use fresh rosemary and thyme, double the amounts, and stir them in just before
  serving.
