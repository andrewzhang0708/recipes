# Peach-Bacon Pie

## Ingredients

 - 2 [self-raising pie crusts][1]

 - 2 to 2 1/2 lbs peaches
 - 1/2 lb bacon
 - 3 large onions
 - 1/4 C flour
 - 1/4 C brown sugar
 - 1 T balsamic vinegar
 - 1 tsp rosemary
 - 2 tsp sea salt
 - black pepper


## Instructions

Fry the bacon until crispy. Keep the grease.  Once the bacon has cooled, chop it
into bacon bits and set these aside.

Chop the onions  and thoroughly caramelize them  in the bacon grease.  Once they
are brown, add the flour and brown sugar. Stir until the onions are coated, then
add the balsamic vinegar, rosemary, and salt.  Remove from heat.

Cut the peaches into chunks.  Add them and the bacon bits  to the onion mixture.
Mix and pour into the pie shell.  Top with the second crust.  Garnish with black
pepper.

Bake at 350 F until golden, about an hour.


## Notes

The flour in this recipe is still experimental - my most recent version  had all
the other ingredients in the proportions given, but no thickener,  and was a bit
soupier than I'd prefer.  You may  want to change the amount,  or use  something
like cornstarch or tapioca instead.

I also tend  to salt to my onions immediately,  rather than  after they're done.
I'm not sure what difference this makes, if any.
