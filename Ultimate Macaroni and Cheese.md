# Ultimate Macaroni and Cheese

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 3/4 C elbow macaroni
- 5 oz extra sharp cheddar cheese

Boil macaroni in salted water until tender but still firm, then drain.  Chop the
cheddar into  1/2-inch  cubes.  Place pasta and cheese cubes  in a buttered 13x9
inch glass casserole dish and mix.

- 3 T flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp ground mustard
- 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
- 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg

Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.

- 1 1/3 C whipping cream
- 1 1/3 C half and half
- 2/3 C sour cream
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.  Start slowly to avoid clumps.

- 5 oz extra sharp cheddar cheese

Pour the cream mixture into the casserole.  Mix as necessary.  Grate the cheddar
and sprinkle it on top.  Bake at 350 F until just set around the edges, about 25
minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes to thicken before serving.
