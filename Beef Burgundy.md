## Notes

[Kitchen Boquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Bouquet)  is a commercial
seasoning sauce.  It sounds like a concentrated vegetable broth.

Boiling onions  are small round onions,  about an inch  to an inch and a half in
diameter. The smaller pearl onions make a good substitute (buy frozen if you can
and save yourself a  _ton_  of time peeling).  Shallots would also make a decent
substitute, as would coarsely chopped yellow onion.
