# Pickled Papaya

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 large unripe papaya
- 2 T salt

Peel and clean the papaya; cut it into thin slices.  Cover the slices
with salt in a medium bowl.  Let sit for fifteen minutes.

- 1/4 C sugar
- 2 in ginger
- 1 habanero

Rinse and drain the papaya slices.  Slice the ginger and habaneros.
Mix these and the sugar into the papaya slices.

- 1 bottle seasoned rice vinegar

Transfer to a sealable container; add rice vinegar until the papaya
slices are just submerged.  Refrigerate for at least two hours.


## Notes

These are technically Malaysian, not Filipino, but I like to make them
with [tapsilog](Tapsilog.md) anyway - you can make them and the
marinade the day before.
