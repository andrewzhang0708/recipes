# Paneer

## Ingredients

 - cheesecloth
 - 1 gal whole milk
 - 4 lemons


## Instructions

Bring half a gallon of milk to a boil  in a Dutch oven or stew pot.  Remove from
the heat and mix in the juice  from two lemons.  Stir until the milk has clearly
separated into white curds and transparent yellow liquid.  Pour into a collander
lined with cheesecloth. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, adding the result
to the same cheesecloth.

Once the curds  have cooled slightly,  press them  (still in the cheesecloth) to
remove extra liquid and firm up the cheese. Let sit for a little while, and then
it's ready.


## Notes

Unless you have a _really_ big pot,  do two batches of boiling as written above.
Milk tends to foam up  very large  and  very fast.  If your cold milk fills more
than half of your pot, your pot is too small.

To get  a satisfying firmness,  I use a cider press and a  significant amount of
pressure.   You can press it under  a weighted plate  as well,  but you'll get a
crumblier cheese.   I've also heard that you can  get a decent cheese by hanging
the cheese from a clothesline  in its cloth, and letting the extra  liquid drain
out that way.

I've heard that the  yellow liquid that I discard  can be good for making sauces
and gravies, but I've never tried.
