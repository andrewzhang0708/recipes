# New York Times Cheesecake

## Ingredients

- 1 graham cracker crust

- 40 oz cream cheese
- 2 T balsamic vinegar
- 1 tsp vanilla

- 1 3/4 C sugar
- 1/4 C flour
- 1/2 tsp salt

- 5 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 heavy cream


## Instructions

Preheat oven to 475 F. While waiting for the oven to heat, make a graham cracker
crust and prebake it in a ten-inch cheesecake pan.

Beat the cream cheese until fluffy.  Mix in vanilla and balsamic vinegar.

Combine sugar, flour, and salt  in a small bowl.  Slowly add these to the cheese
mixture.  Mix in eggs and egg yolks, onne at a time, followed by the cream.

Bake at 475 F for ten minutes,  then reduce oven temperature to 200 F.  Bake for
one hour longer. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside. Chill for
several hours before serving, ideally overnight.


## Notes

This is based on a recipe by Craig Claibone that the New York Times published as
[Deluxe Cheesecake][1] in 1963.  The original recipe calls for lemon zest, but I
didn't have lemons the first time I made it,  and so substituted the tart liquid
I did have handy:  balsamic vinegar.  This proved to be a great improvement over
the original lemon flavor, and I've made it with balsamic vinegar ever since.
