# Pudding

Makes six 3/4-cup puddings.

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1/2 C sugar
- 5 egg yolks
- 2 T corn starch
- pinch salt

Beat the egg yolks and powders well in a medium saucepan.

- 2 1/4 C whole milk

Stir in the milk.  Cook over medium heat until thick and just boiling.

- 6 oz chocolate chips
- 2 T butter
- 1 tsp vanilla

Remove from heat.  Mix in chololate chips; stir until smooth.  Mix in butter and
vanilla.

Pour into six small custard dishes.  Let cool, then refrigerate until fully set,
at least two hours.


## Variations

To make **butterscotch pudding**,  replace the chocolate chips with butterscotch
chips.  Other types of chips are untested,  but should work just as well - maybe
try a **white chocolate pudding** or a **peanut butter pudding**.


## Notes

This is excellent topped with liquid cream!
