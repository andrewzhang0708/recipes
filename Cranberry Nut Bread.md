# Cranberry Nut Bread

Makes one 9x5x3-inch loaf.

## Ingredients & Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 350 F.  You can toast the walnuts as the oven heats;  this will
take about 10 minutes.

- 2 C flour
- 1 C sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt

Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl.

- 1/4 C butter, melted
- 3/4 C orange juice
- 1 T orange zest
- 1 egg

Mix the wet ingredients  in a small bowl,  then pour  into the  dry ingredients.
Stir until just mixed.

- 1/2 C (or more) walnuts, toasted and chopped
- 1 C cranberries, coarsely chopped

Mix in the cranberries and walnuts,  then pour batter into a  greased 9x5x3-inch
loaf pan.  Bake at 350 F for  one hour,  or until bread tests done.  Cool in the
pan for 10 minutes, then remove from pan to finish cooling.


## Notes

We inherited this recipe from my aunt, Katherine "Kak" Burk.

The cranberries can be either dried or fresh.  We use dried, 'cause it's easier.
If you use fresh you may want to add more sugar.

This recipe can also make muffins.  Use a greased muffin tin (with twelve slots)
instead of a loaf pan, and bake for about 25 minutes.
