# Hand-Pulled Noodles

Makes one large serving.

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 C flour
- 1/3 C water
- 1/4 tsp salt

Mix all ingredients.  Knead.  Cover and set aside for 20 minutes.

- oil

Knead some more.  The dough should become very smooth.  Flatten the dough into a
1/2 inch circle and oil well (to preserve moisture).  Cover with plastic wrap or
a plate.  Let stand for 2 hours.

- water

Bring the water to a boil.  Slice the dough circle into 1/2 inch strips.  Gently
stretch these strips  until they become long,  thick noodles.  Place the noodles
directly into the boiling water.  Boil for about two minutes.


## Notes

Use slightly less flour or slightly more water to get a stretchier dough.
