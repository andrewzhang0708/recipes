## Ingredients & Instructions

- 400 g (3 1/4 C) flour
- 200 g (3/4 C + 2 T) water
- 1-2 T salt

Mix all ingredients and knead for 8 to 10 minutes.  Let rest for 30 minutes.

Place the dough in a large plastic bag.  Stomp it into a flat disk.  Repeat five
times total,  then let rest for  at least 2 hours  (refrigerate if significantly
longer).

Roll out into a 1/8-inch-thick rectangle.  Dust with flour or starch.  Fold over
and slice  into square noodles.  Boil for 8 to 10 minutes,  then drain and rinse
with cold water.  Use immediately.


## Notes

The original recipe says to make salt water, then add flour. I doubt it matters.
