# Baked Potatoes

Two large servings.  Good with red wine!


## Ingredients & Instructions

- 2 large starchy potatoes
- salt
- oil

Wash the potatoes,  stab holes in them with a fork,  and rub them with
salt and oil.   Bake them at 400 F for 30 minutes,  then flip them and
bake for 30 minutes more.

- 3 strips bacon

After you flip the potatoes, fry the bacon until crispy.

- 1 large onion
- balsamic vinegar
- salt

Remove the bacon from the frying pan.  Slice the onion thin and fry it
in the bacon grease  until caramelized.  Add balsamic vinegar and salt
and simmer until it's very thick and saucy.

- cheese
- butter
- salt

Chop the bacon  into bits.  Grate  the cheese.  When the  potatoes are
ready,  slice them in half lengthwise and fluff each half with a fork.
Top with butter and salt,  then the onions,  then grated cheese,  then
the bacon bits.  Broil until the cheese melts.


## Notes

The recipes for baked potatoes I've found online all cook for about an
hour, but at wildly varying temperatures - anywhere from 350 to 450 F.
I've averaged it out to 400.  It seems to work well.

These can be very different  depending on what cheese you use, but all
the cheeses I've tried have been quite good.  So just use whatever you
like!
