# Tiramisu

### Custard

- 6 egg yolks
- 3/4 C sugar
- 2/3 C milk
- 1 lb mascarpone

Mik the sugar and egg yolks in a medium saucepan.  Slowly mix in the milk  after
these are blended, then bring to a boil. Boil for about a minute, then chill for
an hour.  Stir in the mascarpone.


### Whipped Cream

- 1 1/4 C whipping cream
- 1/2 tsp vanilla

Whip the cream and vanilla until fluffy.


### Ladyfingers

- 6 oz ladyfingers
- 1/4 C coffee
- 1/4 C rum

Soak the ladyfingers in a mixture of rum and coffee.


### Construction

- cocoa powder

Lay half the soaked ladyfingers  in the bottom of a casserole dish.  Spread with
half the mascarpone custard, then with half the whipped cream. Repeat.  Top with
cocoa powder.  Refrigerate at least four hours - ideally overnight.


## Notes

This is a dessert  that can be endlessly varied.  Every  restaurant I went to in
Italy  had its own  variation  -  different liquors,  different cakes,  raisins,
spices...

My personal variation stemmed  from being unable to find ladyfingers  in England
(I got confused looks  and directions to the produce section).  I ended up using
a strongly almond-flavored cookie of about the same shape and texture, which was
very well suited.  So far, I've been unable to find an equivalent in the US.
