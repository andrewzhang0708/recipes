# Pastrami Bread Pudding

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 6 C rye bread

Preheat oven to 350 F.  Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes;  toast these until they
start to brown, about 20 minutes in the oven while it's pre-heating.

- 2 large leeks
- 1/4 C butter

Halve  the leeks  and slice them thin.  Saute them in butter  in a large skillet
until tender.

- 6 large eggs
- 2 C whole milk
- 2 C heavy cream
- 1 T whole-grain mustard
- 1 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 2 tsp salt

Mix the eggs, milk and cream thoroughly in a large bowl.  Stir in seasonings.

- 1 C Swiss cheese
- 1/2 lb pastrami

Grate the cheese.  Cut the pastrami into 1/4-inch cubes.  Mix cheese,  pastrami,
toasted bread cubes, and sauteed leeks  into the custard.  Pour into a casserole
dish and bake at 350 F until the custard sets  and the top is brown and crunchy,
35 to 45 minutes.


## Notes

We use this  to get rid of bread heels.  Almost any bread works, but if you like
caraway, use Jewish rye!

This works best  when the meat can be cut into true cubes.  Starting with thinly
sliced meats will give  the right flavor,  but won't be as satisfying. ã€€Various
meats can be used: the original recipe used corned beef, our family version uses
pastrami, and our most recent batch used ham.  All are delicious.

The original recipe uses  12 jumbo muffin cups  lined with parchment paper,  but
the casserole dish is a lot easier.
