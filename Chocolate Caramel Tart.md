# Chocolate Caramel Tart

## Sweetcrust

- 2 C flour
- 2/3 C butter
- 1/4 C sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 tsp salt

Knead all crust ingredients together.  Press into a ten-inch tart pan, coming at
least half an inch up the sides of the pan.

Cover with foil  and add pie weights;  bake at 400 F until firm,  ten or fifteen
minutes.  Uncover and continue baking until golden.


## Caramel

- 1 1/2 C sugar
- 1/2 C water (optional)
- 1/3 C butter
- 1/2 C whipping cream

Place  sugar and water  in a clean,  smooth saucepan.  Do not stir.  Simmer over
medium heat  until the bubbling slows  and the sugar turns the copper color of a
new penny.  Remove from heat immediately.

Add butter and stir. The mixture will foam up; continue stirring until it blends
together.  Add cream and repeat.

Pour the hot caramel into the prebaked crust. Do not scrape the pan. Refrigerate
for several hours, until the caramel solidifies.


## Chocolate

- 1/2 C whipping cream
- 8 oz dark chocolate
- 1/4 C sugar (optional)
- 1 tsp vanilla

Bring the whipping cream to a simmer in a medium saucepan.  Remove from heat and
add the chocolate.  If you used a darker, bitterer chocolate, add sugar as well.
Stir until the chocolate melts and the mixture becomes smooth.  Stir in vanilla.

Pour the chocolate over the caramel.  Refrigerate for several more hours,  until
the ganache solidifies.


## Sea Salt

- sea salt (large crystals or flakes)

Sprinkle with sea salt before serving.
