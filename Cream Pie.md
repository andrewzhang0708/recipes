# Cream Pie

## Ingredients

- 1 [pie crust][1]

- 3 C whole milk
- 3/4 C sugar
- 1/3 C flour
- 1/4 tsp salt

- 3 egg yolks

- 2 T butter
- 1 tsp vanilla

- 1 C whipping cream


## Instructions

Make and prebake the pie crust.

Mix the sugar, flour, and salt in a large saucepan.  Add the milk and bring to a
simmer, stirring constantly.  Cook until thickened.

Beat the egg yolks in a small bowl.  Mix a small amount of hot milk mixture into
the egg yolks,  and then  mix the result  back into  the saucepan.  Cook for one
minute more, then remove from heat.  Stir in the butter and vanilla.

Pour the filling into the pie crust.  Chill.  Top with whipped cream and serve.


## Variations

For  **banana cream pie**,  line the baked pie crust  with banana slices  before
pouring in the filling.  This will take two or three bananas.

For **coconut cream pie**,  mix shredded coconut into the filling along with the
butter and vanilla.  Toasted coconut makes a nice topping, but be careful not to
burn it.


## Notes

Meringue lovers  may notice the  three leftover egg whites  and choose to make a
meringue instead of topping with whipped cream.
