# Chocolate Rum Pecan Pie

## Ingredients

- 1 [pie crust][1]

- 1/3 C melted butter
- 1 C dark corn syrup
- 1 C brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 tsp salt

- ~2 C toasted pecans
- 1/2 C chocolate chips
- 1/4 C rum


## Instructions

Mix one pie crust.

Preheat oven to 475 F. Use this to toast the pecans (about ten minutes).

Mix the melted butter, corn syrup, brown sugar, eggs, and salt  in a large bowl.
Stir in the pecans, chocolate chips, and rum.

Roll out the pie crust  and line a pie plate.  Pour in the filling.  Bake for 42
minutes.

Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.


## Notes

The filling tends to be a bit wetter than I like, especially when the pie is hot
out of the oven.  I combat this  by using more brown sugar  and less corn syrup,
and by letting the pie sit overnight  to solidify.  Refrigerating it works quite
nicely as well.

The rum and chocolate chips are both technically optional.  Replace these with a
teaspoon or so of vanilla and you get a traditional pecan pie.
