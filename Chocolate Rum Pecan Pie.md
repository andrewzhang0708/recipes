# Chocolate Rum Pecan Pie

## Ingredients & Instructions

- 1 [pie crust][1]
- \~2 C toasted pecans

Preheat oven  to 375 F.  Mix one pie crust.  Toast the pecans  in the oven while
it's heating - this should take ten or fifteen minutes.

- 1/3 C melted butter
- 1 C dark corn syrup
- 1 C brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 tsp salt

Mix the melted butter, corn syrup, brown sugar, eggs, and salt in a large bowl.

- 1/2 C chocolate chips
- 1/4 C rum

Let the pecans cool slightly. Stir the pecans, chocolate chips, and rum into the
filling.  Roll out the pie crust and line a pie plate. Add the filling.  Bake at
375 F for 42 minutes.

Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.


## Notes

The filling tends to be a bit wetter than I like, especially when the pie is hot
out of the oven.  I combat this  by using more brown sugar  and less corn syrup,
and by letting the pie sit overnight  to solidify.  Refrigerating it works quite
nicely as well.

The rum and chocolate chips are both technically optional.  Replace these with a
teaspoon or so of vanilla and you'll get a traditional pecan pie.
