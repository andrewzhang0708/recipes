# Hungarian Goulash

## Ingredients

- 1 yellow onion
- 5 cloves garlic
- 2 T butter

- 2 T paprika
- 1/2 tsp five spices
- 1/2 tsp allspice

- 1 1/2 pounds beef 
- 1/4 C flour

- 2 C beef broth or water
- 2 tomatoes
- some carrots (optional)
- some potatoes (optional)
- 1 T salt
- 1/2 tsp peper
- 1 tsp light soy sauce (optional)
- 1/2 tsp dark soy sauce (optional)


## Instructions

Cut all vegetables and beef into your favorite shape. Chop garlic into tiny pieces. In a bowl, dredge the stew beef with flour. 

In a large pot, melt butter, add onion and garlic. Once the onion looks translucent, add paprika, five spices and allspice. Stir stir stir, until well mixed.

Throw flour-coated beef into the pot, stir. Cook for a few minutes. Your beef should get nicely coated with the seasonings. Slowly add some beef broth if it becomes dry.

Add all the rest ingredients, bring to boil, reduce to simmer. Cook for 70-90 minutes, then turn the heat up to thicken the stew. (Use hot water/broth to keep the meat from getting too hard.)

Serve it on top of anything! Pasta, ramen, rice, bread or potatoes.
